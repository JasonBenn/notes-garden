title: Visitors to community
---

"Guests seem to be an important part of the cohousing community. Do you see a model where there is a lot of in-out flow in longtterm co-housing?"

Totally. Guests inject New Community Energy and new ideas and conversations, which keep things from getting too insular or stale over the years. If I ever lived rurally, I'd want to be very careful to ensure that we somehow had a steady flow of guests and visitors. Or I'd maintain two locations - one rural and kid-friendly, another urban.
