title: Stochastic Labs
---

Stochastic Labs convenes the best creative minds in the SF bay area and beyond for conversations about the future of technology, science, entrepreneurship, and the arts (in a curious Victorian mansion in Berkeley). Events are by invitation but you can apply for [seed funds](http://stochasticlabs.org/seed-funds/) for your creative tech venture (we take no equity) or to be an [artist/engineer in residence](http://stochasticlabs.org/residencies/) (yes, there’s a laser-cutter and a tower).

## We take no equity. And you keep your IP.

Looking for funding for your creative tech venture? Does your founding team combine engineers and/or scientists with artists (or maybe just a couple polymaths)?  **Selected projects will be granted up to $20k, onsite work space, and shop access** (laser cutter, 3d printer, etc). Unlike traditional tech incubators that fast track participants towards minimal viable product, **Stochastic offers a more reflective, creative environment wherein artists and engineers are encouraged to ask big picture questions** about the future of technology. **Funded teams become part of the Stochastic community**, participating in weekly events with distinguished guests from across the arts, sciences, and tech.

## Creative freedom. Tools. Community.

Stochastic Labs awards **fully sponsored residencies to **exceptional engineers, artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs from around the world. **Residencies are of variable length and include a private apartment at the mansion, co-working and/or dedicated work space, shop access (laser cutter, 3D printer etc), a $1k monthly stipend and a budget for materials**. Residents become part of Stochastic’s creative community, participating in weekly dinners and invitation events. Residents may apply as individuals or as teams. While applicants may be at any stage in their career, the selection is highly competitive.

## Community

Creative coders. Data poets. AR/VR auteurs. Machine-learning virtuosos. Stochastic Labs community members meet at the unchartered intersections that will map the next generation of innovation.

## Impact

Between Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and Oakland, the Bay Area is home to 40% of the venture capital investments in tech start-ups in the United States. The concentration of serial founders, top-level engineers, angels, and even “unicorns” is several multitudes greater here than anywhere else on earth. While exceptional universities like Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCSF; and exciting experimental R&D arms of companies like Google X, fill an important local niche for non-commercial ideation around future technologies, there are few opportunities for engineers to come together to iterate in unpredictable ways, __outside of traditional institutional frameworks__. This kind of independent, creative experimentation is not only critical for the well-being of any future-thinking society, it is often responsible for it. What set of universal moral principles might the artificial intelligence community lean upon without science fiction writer Isaac Asimov’s 3 laws of robotics? What would the history of bio-tech look like without Gregor Mendel’s monastic garden? **An initiative of the Berkeley-based Minerva Foundation, Stochastic Labs operates on an entirely not-for-profit basis, taking zero equity stake in the companies, artworks, and scientific initiatives it incubates**. We are 100% passionate about keeping the SF Bay Area’s innovation culture creative, socially responsible, and independent.

Mission

- To support creative freedom for engineers and scientists outside of traditional institutional frameworks

- To thoughtfully enable the creative ventures, inquiries, and expressions that will shape our technology-driven future

- To build an interdisciplinary community of **artists, engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate in meaningful and unpredictable ways**

History

Since we opened our doors in 2014, Stochastic Labs has helped pioneer exceptional 20th/21st-century creative ventures including Lynn Hershman Leeson and NASA scientist Josiah Zayner’s epic transmedia artwork __The Infinity Engine; __JD Beltran and Scott Minneman’s __Cinema Snowglobe;__ Alexander Reben’s film-making robot __BlabDroid__; Graham Plumb and Karen Marcelo’s volumetric __Open Cube; __street artist KATSU’s __AI Criminals__; and Lauren Mccarthy’s interactive performance piece __Follower__, among others.
