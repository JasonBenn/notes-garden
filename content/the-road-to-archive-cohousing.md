title: The Road to Archive Cohousing

### Location strategy

- **Rural campus with a large guest-house**. Alfred Lee Loomis bought a castle in upstate New York in the early 20th century, converted the basement into a science labratory, and sent first-class plane tickets in the mail to famous scientists around the world. Guests like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and more would visit for months, collaborate, and enjoy opulent summer festivals. The takeaway is that the rural setting enables a more glamorous residence; with this pull residents can invite guests from around the world. Residents would also have space for warehouse-sized makerspaces, sculpture gardens, and sports fields. Modern counterparts include Justin Rosenstein's Agapolis, Garrett Lisi's Pacific Science Institute, or perhaps Tyler Alterman's Portuguese castle. This strategy becomes more desirable - and exotic or tropical locations more feasible - as the world becomes less geographically anchored to their day jobs.

- **Urban serendipity-maximizing condo**. By buying or building a condo building, residents would enjoy a steady flow of new friends and acquaintances that would maximize everyone's luck. By virtue of being in a desirable area of San Francisco, the Archive is able to host speakers while they're in town for conferences, plan parties with 3 hours notice, go event-hopping on weeknights, and host the loosely connected acquaintances that otherwise would never make a trip out into the country. Other examples include Berkeley Moshav.

- **Classic suburban cohousing**. A mix of the above advantages; there are many thriving examples described in Creating Cohousing.

### Getting it built

- **The maximum-effort DIY path**. This is the norm: a handful of burning souls coordinate the purchase of a plot of land, undertake a huge collective financial risk to get their plans approved by disinterested planning departments, and convince unvetted residents to contribute early down payments to finance construction. The whole process is a Herculean feat of coordination and takes 2-5 years and involves $10-30M in total project costs, of which only 70-85% might be financed outside parties. This process is described in detail by Creating Cohousing and the Cohousing Handbook - I recommend both.

- **Expansible, prefabricated homes**. A more affordable variant of the above, a cohousing community composed of tiny, manufactured homes and a shared, site-built common home could reduce costs by 15-50%. The prefab ecosystem is embryonic but ascendant right now as recent California laws like AB-86 have recently massively expanded their addressable market and progressive municipalities on the West Coast are relaxing zoning obstacles. Another advantage to prefab homes is that additions can be easily added as a family unit grows or as financial means change.

- **Partnering with a coliving operator or a developer**. Coliving operators are real-estate developers whose business models include building communities in their portfolio properties. Most suffer from the community-misaligned incentive of maximizing rent and therefore suffer from high churn. As developers, however, they shine at acquiring land, getting plans approved, and financing construction. A partnership would involve a community making a long-term commitment to occupy housing that the developer designs for the community and builds; ownership would transfer over time to the community.
