title: The "MacArchive Genius Grant" business model
---

One business model that might work: the community funds exceptional people to start companies, even before they have an idea.

Here's the deal: Archive Cohousing maintains a guest house with 3-8 bedrooms for this program. We offer free rent for 12 months, a comfortable living stipend, and $250K of investment in exchange for 5% of the company - __before__ the founder knows what they will found.

The thesis is that success in startups is mostly dependent on the strength of the founder(s) and the buoyancy of the market. The kind of value that a collective intelligence like the Archive can add is mostly to steer these talented folks towards __good markets __and __good problems__, along with access to experts in those markets. Before the founder has settled on the problem/solution pair, though, they're in a divergent-thinking, stimulus-maximizing, problem-seeking, customer-interviewing headspace - the exact kind of headspace that you'd naturally occupy while enjoying the [[New Community Energy (not published)]] of a diverse, passionate, future-oriented community of current and former founders.

Of course, there are also instrumental benefits to living in a community like Archive Cohousing. They'd be surrounded by founders with dozens of exits collectively - these residents won't lack for startup expertise and advisors. They'll also benefit from the regular flow of talented people through the community - a fresh flow of potential recruits. Other residents will also likely be interested in investing themselves, or connect them to investors.

This program is heavily inspired -- shamelessly stolen, really -- from South Park Commons, an exclusive coworking space in San Francisco. Their implementation of the program received several thousand applications for 5 spots. The originator of the idea has been executing on the idea since 2017, 100% of the companies went on to raise an A, and are collectively worth about $200M as of December 2020.

A fund like this would likely attract enough LP interest to get over the cold start problem, and within half a decade could make the community financially self-sustaining and build a healthy reserve of [[Squad Wealth]] for the residents.



### Open questions

Founder-market fit

- Reading through Launch Factory's copy made me realize that something is off - the best founders will have been thinking about the right space for years already, it's actually pretty hard to just plug anyone into a promising market

- Maybe a better approach would be to issue calls for startups, and solicit potential founders with expertise in those spaces

- with a themed cohorts approach the founders would also benefit much more from each other, unless they ended up competing lol
