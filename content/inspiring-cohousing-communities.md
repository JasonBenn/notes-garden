## Doyle Street

12 units in a refurbished factory in Emeryville. Overcame fierce neighborhood opposition and has since received praise from their once-enemies in local government and nearby NIMBYs.

## [[Berkeley Cohousing (not published)]]

Features cottage-like smaller homes in backyards. As of September 2019, it became legal to add 1-2 cottages to single-family zoned land in California and rent them out separately (these are called "accessory dwelling units" or ADUs). ADUs are a __big f'ing__ __deal__ and make neighborhoods like [[Berkeley Cohousing (not published)]] much easier to build.

Tiny homes made the last development incredibly cheap! The only building you really need to design is the common area - perhaps you could scale up or down flexibly by adding tiny homes on an as-needed basis.
