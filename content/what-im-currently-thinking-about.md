title: What I'm currently thinking about

The crisis of confidence in the ROI of higher education is leading to the mergers or outright failures of many college campuses. The pandemic has shown the world that many more of us can and should be working remotely. Retail stores and shopping malls are getting crushed by Amazon. All of these trends are creating ever higher vacancy rates for commercial real estate - much of it in cities. How are we gonna make use of it all?? My hope is that much of it should be rezoned into residential land and used to build communities. There's already a trend towards redefining residential zoning to restore "middle" zones: see [[PNW recent rezoning (not published)]].

How might cohousing communities be self-sustaining? [[Squad Wealth]]

A dual-location model of cohousing: one part of the community lives in an urban core, and the remainder live in a more rural location with tons of land. Residents would move freely between them (how would this be coordinated?) and most kids would be raised rurally. The benefit is that the community could maintain a foothold in the city that could be used for events, recruiting, and for people that need to be nearer for commuting purposes; they could retire to the rural location for weekends. If [[Agape]] and [[Agapolis (not published)]] are anything to go by, the challenge of such an arrangement is keeping the communities feeling like one instead of two.

Who is the Ocean's Eleven of cohousing? Could their visions be merged such that they could collaborate on one epic project? See: [[Communities that are also interested in cohousing (not published)]].
