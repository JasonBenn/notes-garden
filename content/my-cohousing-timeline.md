title: My cohousing timeline
---

I love doing AI research, and hope to play an important role in the development of general intelligence. But I can't stop thinking about building a truly epic cohousing project with [[The Ocean's Eleven of Cohousing (not published)]].

I've discovered that when I try to work on two totally different research projects concurrently, I do a mediocre job at both. So I'm going to try doing them sequentially.

Specifically, I hope to focus all of my good thinking energy on AI for the next 12-24 months. After this, I'll go community hopping around the world with my girlfriend, living in great cohousing villages for a month each and immersing myself in different cultures and locations. During this period I'll mostly study what works, what doesn't, meet other burning souls, develop systems, devise a working business model, recruit residents and investors, and decide where to build.

After this I'll find and coordinate the purchase of a site and oversee design and construction. Once the project has stabilized I'll resume my AI career.
