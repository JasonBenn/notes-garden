title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Jason Benn](https://jasonbenn.com). I have a somewhat contrarian belief that most people would be happier and more successful if they lived communally, and these are my working notes.

These notes are meant more as conversation starters than as a polished blog. Some notes are polished, but others are just questions or even stubs. Many contain explicit asks for help - usually of the format "Can you connect me to someone that knows about X?" You can find a list of them on my [Github](https://github.com/JasonBenn/notes-garden/tree/master/content), but really they're meant to be explored, choose-your-own-adventure style. If anything strikes you, don't hesitate to reach out -- especially if you disagree!

Themes include...

- narratives that (hopefully) resonate with people,

- open questions,

- [[Note not published]],

- [[Note not published]],

- what I've learned from living at [the Archive](https://archive.house) and interviewing dozens of community leaders,

- the roadmap to building a cohousing community ([[The Road to Archive Cohousing]]),

- [[Note not published]]

- and big dreams about the long-term future.

[[Note not published]]

- The ideas in these notes have come from conversations with hundreds of people: community leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, developers, architects, skeptics. 

        - mechanism designers, systems thinkers, popular people, lonely people, and ordinary people, kids, grandparents, hucksters, incels, 

- I like keeping them out in the open because they lead to more, great conversations

        - also because i hope to inspire more people to organize

        - and because i hope to reduce the barriers to entry, which are steep, and think that acting as a hub of ideas between developers, investors, landowners, and community builders might enable some innovation. i'm still on the hunt - here are some candidates... [[Note not published]]

[[Note not published]]

- Hey! I'm [Jason Benn](https://jasonbenn.com/). I have a strongly held contrarian belief that most people would be happier and more successful if they lived communally.

- These notes are a bit unusual, so let me orient you. They're a continual work in progress. Some are polished, some are stubs, and some are just questions I'm thinking about. You could find a list of all of them on my [Github](https://github.com/JasonBenn/notes-garden/tree/master/content), but really they're meant to be explored, choose-your-own-adventure style. My hope is that they will start conversations, so if anything resonates with you, don't hesitate to reach out!

- To give you a broad idea of the contents, these notes are where I...

        - iterate on narratives that resonate with people,

        - collect inspiring examples ([Note not published](https://notesgardenmaster.gtsb.io/note-not-published)),

        - articulate open questions,

        - describe what I've learned from living at [the Archive](https://archive.house/) and interviewing dozens of community leaders,

        - outline the roadmap to building a cohousing community ([The Road to Archive Cohousing](https://notesgardenmaster.gtsb.io/the-road-to-archive-cohousing)),

        - and dream big about the possibilities.

- I also maintain a list of what I'm currently thinking about ([What I'm currently thinking about](https://notesgardenmaster.gtsb.io/what-im-currently-thinking-about)).
