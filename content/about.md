title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Jason Benn](https://jasonbenn.com). I have a somewhat contrarian belief that most people would be happier and more successful if they lived communally, and these are my working notes.

These notes are meant more as conversation starters than as a polished blog. Some notes are polished, but others are just questions or even stubs. Many contain explicit asks for help - usually of the format "Can you connect me to someone that knows about X?" You can find a list of them on my [Github](https://github.com/JasonBenn/notes-garden/tree/master/content), but really they're meant to be explored, choose-your-own-adventure style. If anything strikes you, don't hesitate to reach out -- especially if you disagree!

Themes include...

- narratives that (hopefully) resonate with people,

- [[What I'm currently thinking about]],

- [[Inspiring Cohousing Communities]],

- what I've learned from living at [the Archive](https://archive.house) and interviewing dozens of community leaders,

- the roadmap to building a cohousing community ([[The Road to Archive Cohousing]]),

- [[Ways to help]]

- and big dreams about the long-term future.
