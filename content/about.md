title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Jason Benn](https://jasonbenn.com). I have a strongly held contrarian belief that most people would be happier and more successful if they lived communally.

These notes are a bit unusual, so let me orient you. They're a continual work in progress. Some are polished, some are stubs, and some are just questions I'm thinking about. You could find a list of all of them on my [Github](https://github.com/JasonBenn/notes-garden/tree/master/content), but really they're meant to be explored, choose-your-own-adventure style. My hope is that they will start conversations, so if anything resonates with you, don't hesitate to reach out!

To give you a broad idea of the contents, these notes are where I...

- iterate on narratives that resonate with people,

- collect inspiring examples ([[Note not published]]),

- articulate open questions,

- describe what I've learned from living at [the Archive](https://archive.house) and interviewing dozens of community leaders,

- outline the roadmap to building a cohousing community ([[The Road to Archive Cohousing]]),

- and dream big about the possibilities.

I also maintain a list of what I'm currently thinking about ([[What I'm currently thinking about]]).
