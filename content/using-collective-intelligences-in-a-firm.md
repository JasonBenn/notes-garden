title: Using collective intelligences in a firm
---

## Open problems, weaknesses, questions, ideas

- "Open question: difference between supermind and organizations/contests?"

- "Like **group intelligence is probably a spectrum**. And I would say a lot of groups have like lower intelligence. A lot of wasted effort coordination overhead."

        - "A dimension of variation is how much effort is wasted: how cooperative vs competitive."

        - They also vary in terms of quality of solutions produced.

            - Do Chinese superconglomerates, which are cooperative and not competitive (all labor comes from one firm), produce better or worse products? Are they more efficient?

                - Probably not. Inefficiency is outside the competitive firm: waste borne by the losers.

        - Are there other ways superminds can be smart or dumb?

            - Yes: read the wiki.

- "What problems are separable? Which are not?"

- General frame: divide, solve, combine.

- Other dimensions: what makes them smarter, dumber?

- What superminds work best based on characteristics of the problem?

        - Problem complexity?

        - Problem separability?

- Does Climate Colab actually work?

        - Read some random posts, have some doubts... seems like nonprofits.

        - Not sure how to identify this, because book had good examples.

- General principle: prioritize things by information content gained.

        - We are often too slow to try to disprove our own ideas.

        - We often try easier tasks first, when instead we should try the most informative tasks first.

# Outline

- A theory of the firm

        - "We begin with the assumption that the manager’s knowledge-based objective is to create valuable new knowledge. The manager, however, cannot simply choose new knowledge to acquire, because more often than not the desired knowledge does not exist. Instead, ^^the manager must choose valuable problems^^—those which, if successfully solved, yield desirable knowledge or capability."

            - Or they don't know what they don't know

        - "Once a problem is selected, ^^the manager then organizes a search^^ for solutions that optimizes the likelihood, speed, and cost with which valuable solutions are discovered"

        - "Thus, the unit of analysis in our theory is the problem, and profitable formation of new knowledge (or new capability) is ^^the central goal in choosing a form of governance^^"

- Theory: choosing governance/supermind structure depends on problem and complexity of the problem...?

        - **How**? This is an interesting topic.

            - "when to reach for external information, when to stay in the firm."

                - "project is well defined"

                - "independent of other problems"

                - "problems benefit from specialized knowledge"

            - "doesn't seem to work as well with climate colab, where problems are densely connected"

- identifying problems

        - Rust open source governance

            - Rust open source governance does a really good job of just like identifying a big problem theme per year. And in doing so inspiring, a whole, you know, legion of open source programmers that are very self directed to solve those things. And at the end of the year they review how far they come in and most years they've seemed to have been very successful. 

        - This is also the function of just advocacy groups, right, a lot of them aren't advocating solutions, they're just raising awareness of problems and Black Lives Matter could be an example of this.

        - Then, in 2013, we began to systematically divide the problem of what to do about climate change into a family of a dozen or more related contests, each focused on a different aspect of the problem. For instance, we held separate contests fr proposals on how to reduce emissions in transportation, buildings, and electricity generation, on how to change public attitudes about climate, and on how to put a price on carbon emissions (which most experts believe is a critical leverage point in addressing climate change).

            - For example, in 2013, we held a contest on how to replace diesel energy with renewable energy, especially in developing countries. The winning proposal came from a nonprofit organization in India. It described how small Indian farms could replace their expensive, emission-intensive diesel irrigation pumps with much cheaper and more environmentally friendly foot-powered treadle pumps.

            - When we looked at this proposal, it was obvious that its authors were deeply connected to the culture of small farming communities in India. They even included a video featuring an Indian farmer named Budhiram, whose life was changed by using such a pump

            - When we divided the problem in this way, we began to receive many more detailed and interesting proposals

            - demonstrates value of ^^web of problems, and great managers identifying great problems^^

        - When Topcoder develops software for a customer, it breaks the work up into much smaller pieces than would be common in a typical software company. Then, for each of these pieces, it holds an online contest where members of Topcoder’s worldwide community of over one million freelance software developers compete to do the task.

            - For instance, the contest organizers might provide a high-level description of the project’s goals and challenge developers to create a specifications document that best translates those goals into detailed system requirements. (Topcoder hosts a web forum that allows developers to query the client for more details, and all those questions and answers become visible to all competitors.) The winning specifications document might become the basis for the next contest, in which other developers compete to design the system’s architecture, specifying the various pieces of software to be developed and the connections between them. Further contests would be launched to develop each of the pieces separately, then others would integrate the pieces into a single working whole.

        - The book introduces the world of hyperconnectivity and intelligence through the example of the Polymath project in 2009 (p. 5), which was an open online-based project to prove the Hales–Jewett theorem. With the help of 39 people and 1500 comments, in two months the proof was completed.

            - By mid-March, the participants had solved the core of the problem. By the end of May, there had been over 1,500 comments in which 39 different people made substantive contributions. And in October, the group submitted the first of several articles describing their results, all of which were attributed to “D. H. J. Polymath,” a pseudonym for the whole group.3

- searching for solutions!

        - InnoCentive: Alaska-based Oil Spill Recovery Institute (OSRI), which created contests asking for methods to deal with crude oil when it spills into frigid ocean waters (which is what happened in 1989 during the __Exxon Valdez__ oil spill). One specific challenge was how to separate oil from water on [oil-recovery barges after the oil and water had frozen into a viscous mass.

            - The winning solution to this problem came from John Davis, a chemist in Bloomington, Illinois, whose relevant experience was having worked on a construction site in a summer job. He realized that the same kind of vibrating devices that keep concrete from hardening prematurely on construction sites could also be used, with minor modifications, to keep oil from congealing in cold water.

        - Kaggle

        - the Foldit community uncovered the structure of an enzyme related to AIDS that had eluded scientists for 15 years. It only took the Foldit community three weeks!

            - You ever to fold it. It's kind of like a SETI at home type. It's a game where you try and predict how a protein folds from DNA. And some brilliant UI slash game designers figured out how to make this like intuitive enough, that people could play it as though it were a video game. And the folded community uncovered the structure of an enzyme related to AIDS had alluded scientists for 15 years, took the folder community three weeks. I don't know how competitive that is but it's interesting I should look into it.

        - concurrent engineering

        - manhattan project: collaborative

- solution evaluation (synthesizing, choosing) can also be incentivized, massivized

        - paying people for synthesis

            - The similarity between contest webs and supply webs for physical products suggests an obvious answer to these questions: the creators of integrated proposals can “pay” the creators of the other entries they use, which motivates groups to create proposals that others want to use. To implement this idea in Climate CoLab, we created an artificial currency called CoLab points, which eventually get converted to dollars (in 2015, members received two dollars for every CoLab point), and we created an automatic pricing scheme to distribute these points.

        - separating evaluation

            - In a good contest web for corporate strategy, for instance, you probably want one group of people evaluating whether it is technically feasible to make a product, another group estimating how much it will cost to make the product, and still another group predicting whether people will bauy it. In many cases, you won’t care whether these people are inside your company or not. For instance, you might want an outside market researcher to estimate demand for skin-care products at different prices

                - One simple way of aggregating people’s opinions about this question would be to take a poll among experts about the likely costs. A more interesting possibility would be to create a conditional prediction market, in which many people make predictions about what the eventual costs would be if the product is produced.

                - Either way, it might be useful to let people enter detailed arguments online for and against the different points of view, which could inform the people who are participating in the prediction market

            - good judgment project

                - It’s certainly not easy to rapidly filter ideas without missing many of these “diamonds in the rough.” Maybe

                - By systematically tracking over time how accurately (and how early) people predict technological advances and other kinds of breakthroughs

            - You could also have people like you know argue things for against or use a prediction market or assemble a team of super forecasters. All of these things can help you predict the comparative value of solutions

- conclusion

        - The system we’ve just seen is focused on strategic decision making, but what we’ve really seen is an architecture for a general-purpose problem-solving machine. As we saw in chapter 13, this type of problem-solving machine is more like a combination of markets (such as the supply chain for manufacturing cars) than it is like a traditional hierarchy. It is a kind of ecosystem supermind that combines markets (the contests), communities (for proposing ideas), democracies, and hierarchies (for evaluating ideas). And it lets a large group of people and machines apply many more kinds of knowledge and explore many more possibilities than traditional hierarchical problem-solving processes do.

        - we'll have general problem solving this way long before we have proper AGI.

        - controlling this might even be an avenue for safety research.

        - A history of massive-scale intelligences

        - Topcoder’s founder, Jack Hughes, for instance, believes that the discretion the company’s software developers have in choosing what to work on is a leading reason for his community’s high productivity

            - ML to help people find problems?

        - "But instead we found that the people who were not the usual suspects were just as likely to become finalists. Of the people who submitted proposals, people who had no graduate school training and no previous climate-change experience were just as likely to become finalists as those with the opposite characteristics."

            - Surprising insight, benefit of scaling up large

            - Diversity matters, not just consulting experts

        - On December 5, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., DARPA positioned 10 large red weather balloons at 10 undisclosed but publicly visible locations scattered across the United States. The challenge, which DARPA had announced several weeks earlier, was to find all 10 balloons as rapidly as possible. The first group to do so would receive a prize of $40,000.

# Captain's Log: [[June 29th, 2020 (not published)]]

- ### Morning

- 8:00 AM: [[Thomas Malone (not published)]] teaches 15.320 Strategic Organizational Design at MIT.

        - Topics include when to use ^^functional, divisional, or matrix organizations^^; how IT creates new organizational possibilities; examples of innovative organizational possibilities, such as ^^democratic decision-making, crowd-based organizations, and other forms of collective intelligence^^

            - What are those?

        - Are these forms of collective intelligence things that can be deployed, ad-hoc, for certain problems?

- 8:16 AM: what the hell? "Early work on this project included development of an online [Handbook of Collective Intelligence](http://scripts.mit.edu/~cci/HCI/index.php?title=Main_Page), editable, like Wikipedia, by anyone interested.  This site is ^^no longer actively being edited^^, but is included here for historical reasons."

        - Why the hell not? I feel like this guy is just tired or lazy or something.

- **George Herman** __MIT Sloan School - Center for Coordination Science__ "The [Process Handbook](http://ccs.mit.edu/ph) is an online repository of business processes that uses two novel concepts, those of specialization and dependencies.

        - now defunct. Wonder if they even still exist? Maybe I should call them...

- {{[[DONE (not published)]]}} Pomo 2 8:22 AM: keep exploring.

        - "Organization Studies" journal published a review of Superminds, with a few interesting references:

            - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840620929989

            - Mostly positive, thin on AI, inspiring writer, interesting, broad concept. Generally positive!

        - https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/19416520802211644

            - We begin by juxtaposing the pervasive presence of technology in organizational work with its absence from the organization studies literature. Our analysis of four leading journals in the field confirms that over 95% of the articles published in top management research outlets do not take into account the role of technology in organizational life. We then examine the research that has been done on technology, and categorize this literature into two research streams according to their view of technology: __discrete entities__ or __mutually dependent ensembles__. For each stream, we discuss three existing reviews spanning the last three decades of scholarship to highlight that while there have been many studies and approaches to studying organizational interactions and implications of technology, empirical research has produced mixed and often‐conflicting results. Going forward, we suggest that further work is needed to theorize the fusion of technology and work in organizations, and that additional perspectives are needed to add to the palette of concepts in use. To this end, we identify a promising emerging genre of research that we refer to under the umbrella term: __sociomateriality__. Research framed according to the tenets of a sociomaterial approach challenges the deeply taken‐for‐granted assumption that technology, work, and organizations should be conceptualized separately, and advances the view that there is an inherent inseparability between the technical and the social. We discuss the intellectual motivation for proposing a sociomaterial research approach and point to some common themes evident in recent studies. We conclude by suggesting that a reconsideration of conventional views of technology may help us more effectively study and understand the multiple, emergent, and dynamic sociomaterial configurations that constitute contemporary organizational practices.

        - 8:36 AM: the "with norms and processes" "with technology" "with both" organization was dumb, remove.

        - https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0093

            - In this paper we develop a knowledge-based theory of the firm. While existing knowledge-based theory focuses on the efficiency of hierarchy in economizing on knowledge exchange, we develop a theory of the firm that focuses on the efficiency of ^^alternative organizational forms in __generating__ knowledge or capability^^. Our theory begins with ^^the problem as the basic unit^^ of analysis, arguing that a ^^**problem's complexity** influences the optimal method of solution search^^ and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing.

- {{[[DONE (not published)]]}} Pomo 3 8:48 AM: read the knowledge theory of a firm - that sounds really, really good.

        - SIGCHI [Lifetime Achievement Award to James D Hollan: "Thinking with Computers"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SIGCHI-Lifetime-Research-Award-Talk%3A-Thinking-with-Hollan/55dc7581153997368c85415a6eac4e6801f710c6) - not super relevant, more about Mercury OS, bridging apps together. Also cool, to be sure, but it's more about collecting machines, apps, and data, than collecting people and machines.

            - We think with things, with our bodies, with marks on paper, and with other people. Thinking is a distributed, situated, and social activity that exploits the extraordinary facilities of language, representational media, and embodied interaction with the world. Today we increasingly think with computers. This includes desktop and laptop computers but more and more involves massive computer networks that deliver search results and provide access to a vast array of cloud-based services. At the same time, the monolithic computer of the recent past is coming apart and being reassembled in myriad new forms, including cell phones, tablets, digital pens, cameras that allow focusing after a picture is taken, glasses that can take a picture of what we see and tell us about it, sensors that capture our activity and support interaction by movement of hands and bodies as well as voice and eyes, and even cars that drive themselves. We are on the threshold of an era that is being described as the Internet of Things or, perhaps more accurately, as the Internet of Everything. 

            - ^^The historical moment when people primarily worked in front of a single computer has passed. Computers are ubiquitous^^. They are being embedded in virtually every new device and the Internet and wireless communication enable their connection to each other and to ever-expanding information resources with previously unimaginable computational power. 

            - This is being accelerated by a radically changing cost structure in which the price is the same or less to use a thousand computers for a minute or a day than to use one computer for a thousand minutes or days. 

            - These and related developments are fundamentally changing the world in which we live and the ways we think, communicate, and interact within it. 

            - Yet for all their capacity and speed, using computers too often remains difficult, awkward, and frustrating. Even after six decades of design evolution there is little of the naturalness, spontaneity, and contextual sensitivity that characterize other activities nor is there the conviviality and flexibility of working with tangible media. 

            - Most time using computers is spent within applications, each designed to support specific functions and ^^allowing interaction with information in only predetermined ways^^ that are rarely sensitive to overall activity context or history of use and ^^far too often we can look, but not touch^^, annotate, or personalize the information involved. Access to information needed to conduct daily life is spread across multiple applications and resources, resulting in fragmentation of activities and increased complexity. 

            - The rapidly expanding world of mobile apps, which are often walled off from each other and from other information sources, and the increasing use of multiple devices further fragments the ways we work and interact. Although we commonly use paper and digital work materials together, they remain elements of two distinct worlds. Disconnects between digital and physical worlds, lack of naturalness and context sensitivity, inability to tailor and personalize information and our interaction with it, and fragmentation of real activities across multiple applications and devices are systemic problems and unfortunately becoming accepted features of modern life. In this talk I argue that ^^we need to challenge the legacy document- and application-centric view of information^^. 

            - We must design environments that move beyond simple metaphor-based imitation of static information entities to ones in which information is dynamic, operating according to cognitively-inspired physics that exploit human abilities, are sensitive to context and history, link the digital and physical worlds, and support web-scale information activities.

            - A central role of the entrepreneur-manager is assembling a strategic bundle of complementary assets and activities, either existing or foreseen, which when combined create value for the firm. This process of creating value however requires managers to ^^assess which activities should be handled by the market and which should be handled within hierarchy^^. Indeed, for more than forty years, economists, sociologists and organizational scholars have extensively examined the theory of the firm’s central question: what determines the boundaries of the firm?

                - What work do we do vs outsource?

            - Many alternative theories have emerged and are frequently positioned as competing explanations, often with no shortage of critique for one another. In this paper, we review these theories and suggest that the core theories that have emerged to explain the boundary of the firm commonly address distinctly different directional forces on the firm boundary - forces that are tightly interrelated. We specifically address these divergent, directional forces - as they relate to organizational boundaries - by focusing on four central questions. 

            - First, what are the virtues of markets in organizing assets and activities? 

            - Second, what factors drive markets to fail? 

            - Third, what are the virtues of integration in organizing assets and activities? 

            - Fourth, what factors drive organizations to fail? 

            - We argue that a complete theory of the firm must address these four questions and we review the relevant literature regarding each of these questions and discuss extant debates and the associated implications for future research.

        - a more practical approach to organizational design, this perspective employs the problem as the basic unit of analysis (Nickerson, Silverman, & Zenger, 2007) and emphasizes four activities: (1) problem finding, framing, and formulating; (2) problem solving; (3) solution implementation; and (4) operating implemented solutions

        - ‌OK, maybe this is it! 

        - In the strategy literature, a key task of the manager is to accumulate and protect valuable knowledge or capability

        - Arguably, however, the key knowledge- based question the manager faces is not how to organize to exploit already developed knowledge or capability, but rather how to organize to efficiently generate knowledge and capability.

        - We begin with the assumption that the manager’s knowledge-based objective is to create valuable new knowledge. The manager, however, cannot simply choose new knowledge to acquire, because more often than not the desired knowledge does not exist. Instead, ^^the manager must choose valuable problems^^—those which, if successfully solved, yield desirable knowledge or capability.

        - Once a problem is selected, ^^the manager then organizes a search^^ for solutions that optimizes the likelihood, speed, and cost with which valuable solutions are discovered

            - Thus, the unit of analysis in our theory is the problem, and profitable formation of new knowledge (or new capability) is ^^the central goal in choosing a form of governance^^

By ^^analyzing 1,072 external knowledge search efforts^^ I show that ^^incumbents have positive effects on problem-solving related to competence-enhancing technologies^^. 

                - "Positive effects"?

                - What "competence-enhancing technologies"?

            - However, organizing such efforts to involve incumbent firms as a knowledge source has a negative effect, which I argue is caused by their inertia related to ^^competence-destroying technologies^^.

                - ?

            - Finally, I show that incumbents who proactively lead technological change and engage in reconfiguration of their competences have positive effects in competence-destroying technologies. The findings contribute to extant literature by showing the influence of ^^individual knowledge sources on the problem-solving likelihood of external knowledge search efforts^^, and the contingencies regarding the organization of these efforts conditional on the commitment of individual knowledge sources to the resultant technological change.

        - notes

            - The third chapter of the dissertation examines the specific role of ^^advocacy groups in overcoming the threat of mutual confusion^^ as external knowledge search efforts develop ^^solutions to society’s largest problems, i.e. “grand challenges^^”. 

            - With my coauthors we consider these grand challenges to be large-scale problems, which require solutions to be developed through external knowledge search efforts due to their interconnectedness and complex nature. 

            - ^^We propose that firms can address the individual sub-problems that comprise the grand challenges through external search efforts that draw on multiple knowledge sources.^^

- Probably "Andy's systemization of thinking" and "VCs on Twitter" don't fit the theme

- 11:59 AM: just got back, got a chair and snacks and talked to [[Abe Fetterman (not published)]].

- {{[[DONE (not published)]]}} Pomo 6: summarize points in my conversation with Abe.

        - Open question: difference between supermind and organizations/contests?

        - "Is any contest is a supermind...?"

            - A dimension of variation is how much effort is wasted: how cooperative vs competitive.

        - Like **group intelligence is probably a spectrum**. And I would say a lot of groups have like lower intelligence. A lot of wasted effort coordination overhead.

- Distracted for a while by Asana. But it was interesting and not wasteful! Learned about Lemonade's amazing IPO - AI insurance, founded in 2015, with hundreds of M in investment in NYC. Also: opinion polls in med, and reading covid comments on Fox, holy shite.

- OK: make lunch, plan afternoon at Corona Heights.

- ### Afternoon 

- {{[[TODO (not published)]]}} 2:21 PM: pomo 7: abe convo, open questions, ideas, next directions, visit tina

- {{[[TODO (not published)]]}} finish pulling out Abe points

- Abe: counter-idea: concurrent engineering. 

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fjason%2F-ntIfJ31vN.png?alt=media&token=e01d068b-f6c0-4c68-8445-f64dfed97726)

        - Waterfall on left, concurrent on right

            - Idea: tighter loops allow iteration.

        - Compare:

            - "Giving the designer ^^ownership is claimed to improve the productivity of the employee^^ and quality of the product, based on the assumption that people who are given a sense of gratification and ownership over their work tend to work harder and design a more robust product, as opposed to an employee that is assigned a task with little say in the general process."

            - vs: hyperspecialization enables choice, which unlocks productivity "Topcoder’s founder, Jack Hughes, for instance, believes that the discretion the company’s software developers have in choosing what to work on is a leading reason for his community’s high productivity"

            - theory of motivation is much larger than ownership vs agency. they can both be true.

- Coool! Different Colabs for different scenarios:

        - Earth in 30 years: https://news.climatecolab.org/2018/11/final-report-from-futures-colab-a-scenario-development-exercise-from-climateworks-foundation-mit-cci-future-earth-released-today/

- Wait... Climate Colab seems to mostly be fielding proposals from large orgs seeking grant money, and unserious proposals from randos... https://www.climatecolab.org/contests/2017/carbon-pricing is that true? Our Climate and CitizensClimateLobby both proposed, then seem to have way more voters than others.

        - Cleverly, final awards are given by judges, so votes don't really matter much except to steer the attention of onlookers.

        - Huh, this is fascinating. Most proposals seem too broad to be very helpful. 

        - I bet coordinating people that should talk with each other would be helpful/good.

- 3:22 PM: OK, back at it. Resume.

        - For certain problems, you want to separate problem into pieces. For others, you don't. Sometimes, you want waterfall.

        - What problems are separable? Which are not?

- China: superconglomerates. 

        - Do they produce worse products?

            - The interesting things about sort of product design. I know in in Japan it's like one person will be like responsible for like one part, like they design with the one part. And it's like, it takes them so much longer than someone here would take that part. But like they're completely responsible like if that part fails like it's they're, like, wow, they're like personally responsible for that failure, whereas here it's like oh like this is what he paid for whatever.

        - The joint CIDL-CSLI project involved 38 executives from across Takeda applying principles from Thomas Malone’s book Superminds to address an important business problem: how to use innovative socio-technical solutions to ^^tackle depression among working age people in Japan^^.

        - The ideas generated by the Takeda executives and the MIT group were then synthesized by the CIDL team and reviewed by all participants.

        - The concept that emerged was CareNet, a web-enabled collected intelligence system that relies on a ^^combination of human expertise and artificial intelligence to diagnose and recommend actions^^ that can help people who are susceptible to or suffering from depression, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers.‌

        - Finding innovative solutions to complex problems is often about ^^finding people who have access to novel information^^ and alternative viewpoints. Research has found that most people are connected to each other through just a few degrees of separation, but ^^successful social search is often difficult^^ because it depends on people using their weak ties to make connections to distant social networks. 

        - Recursive incentive schemes have shown promise for social search by ^^motivating people to use their weak ties^^ to find distant targets, such as specific people or even weather balloons placed at undisclosed locations. Here, we report on a case study of a similar recursive incentive scheme for finding innovative ideas. 

        - Specifically, we implemented a competition to reward individual(s) who helped refer Grand Prize winner(s) in MIT’s Climate CoLab, an open innovation platform for addressing global climate change. Using data on over 78,000 CoLab members and over 36,000 people from over 100 countries who engaged with the referral contest, we find that people who are referred using this method are more likely than others both to submit proposals and to submit high quality proposals. 

        - Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that among the contributors referred via the contest, ^^those who had more than one degree of separation from a pre-existing CoLab member were more likely to submit high quality proposals^^. Thus, the results from this case study are consistent with the theory that people from distant networks are more likely to provide innovative solutions to complex problems. More broadly, the results suggest that ^^rewarding indirect intermediaries^^ in addition to final finders may promote effective social network recruitment.

        - ‌Researchers in many disciplines have previously used a variety of mathematical techniques for ^^analyzing group interactions^^. Here we use a new metric for this purpose, called “integrated information” or “phi.” Phi was originally developed by neuroscientists as a measure of consciousness in brains, but it captures, in a single mathematical quantity, two properties that are important in many other kinds of groups as well: ^^differentiated information and integration^^. Here we apply this metric to the activity of three types of groups that involve people and computers. First, we find that 4-person work groups with higher measured phi perform a wide range of tasks more effectively, as measured by their collective intelligence. Next, we find that groups of Wikipedia editors with higher measured phi create higher quality articles. Last, we find that ^^the measured phi of the collection of people and computers communicating on the Internet increased over a recent six-year period^^. Together, these results suggest that integrated information can be a useful way of characterizing a certain kind of interactional complexity that, at least sometimes, predicts group performance. In this sense, ^^phi can be viewed as a **potential metric of effective group collaboration**^^.

- 4:04 PM: going outside to read for an hour or so. Then, conversation with KJ about my questions?

        - Ended up reading Intelligence Genome and Handbook of CI, neither particularly helpful. Tomorrow, read about phi.

- 7:50 PM: [[Daily [[Review]] (not published)]] "if every day was like today, did I do enough to move me towards each of my goals?": yes, absolutely. My morning was very productive: I should always aim to generate an idea, research it, and validate it in half a day! Wow. That's a lot of posts. Typical post might go through 2-3 revisions? Aim to publish tomorrow night. Tomorrow morning: research the problems above, being open-minded to different outlines, then get KJ's feedback.

### Captain's Log: [[June 30th, 2020 (not published)]]

- WGAN guy: organizes unconference with 20 people in Mexico every year to decide what the important problems are. Not on Twitter. Rule: can't talk about anything that's already been done.

- 10:10 AM: themes:

        - when to reach for external information, when to stay in the firm.

            - project is well defined

            - independent of other problems

            - problems benefit from specialized knowledge

        - doesn't seem to work as well with climate colab, where problems are densely connected

        - improving reach of loose connections with ML

- how is good judgment different from contests?

- josh: genetic algorithm wastes a lot. backprop doesn't. interesting!

        - backprop is metrics-driven optimization. facebook measures attention.

- laura: more evolved species have better group intelligence. group intelligence = fitness, not individual survival.

        - species, too. viruses, bacteria mutate faster.

- koch brothers, stripe: internally, a bunch of bets with assymetric upside. the research paper!
